"0","#| tbl-cap: Summary of results from MCMC algorithm used to estimate the rate of C-sections at a hospital.  The model was fit with Stan; 3 chains were generated, each with 5000 iterations and a burn-in of 2000 for a total of 9000 post-burn-in variates.  The 95% credible interval reported is an equal-tailed interval."
