{"title":"Considerations when Comparing Independent Groups","markdown":{"headingText":"Considerations when Comparing Independent Groups","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-independent-groups","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n{{< include _setupcode.qmd >}}\n\nWhile the approaches we have described in the text have been general, we have generally assumed we were modeling a single variable from a single population.  That is, we were interested in characterizing the data generating process for a response $Y$; specifically, we assumed the density $f(y \\mid \\bs{\\theta})$ depended on unknown parameters $\\bs{\\theta}$.  We would use a random sample $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n$ from this population to make inference on those parameters.  Many questions do not fit into that mold.\n\n:::{#exm-distracted-driving}\n## Distracted Driving\nNearly every state in the US has a restriction on cell phone use while driving.  Some states prohibit texting while driving, while states like Indiana only permit hands-free use of a phone.  The goal of these regulations is to reduce distractions while driving and thereby improve reaction time.  \n:::\n\nDoes cell phone use reduce reaction time?  Does it increase the likelihood of a collision?  These questions seek to compare a response (the reaction time) across groups formed by the predictor (cell phone use or not).  There are two ways to conceptually think about this comparison.  First, we could think of there being two independent populations --- those who use cell phones while driving, and those who do not use cell phones while driving.  In this perspective, we are interested in comparing these two populations, and we imagine sampling from each population separately.  Alternatively, we could think of there being a single population (those who drive) exposed to two different treatments (using cell phones and not using cell phones).  In this perspective, we are interested in comparing the impact of the treatments on the response, and we imagine sampling from the single population and then each unit being allocated one of the treatment groups.  While the details are different between these two perspectives, mathematically, they are equivalent.\n\nLet's first consider the perspective of two independent populations.  Specifically, let $Y_{j,i}$ be the response for the $i$-th observation in population $j$, $i = 1, 2, \\dotsc, n_j$, where $n_j$ is the number of subjects observed from population $j$ and $j = 1, 2, \\dotsc, J$, where $J$ is the number of populations being compared.  Further, we assume $Y_{j, i} \\stackrel{IID}{\\sim} f_j\\left(y \\mid \\bs{\\theta}_j\\right)$; that is, we have a random sample from each population.  Notice that we are potentially allowing the form of the data generating process $f$ to vary for each population; and, we certainly allow the parameters $\\bs{\\theta}$ to vary for each population.  Since we consider each sample independent of one another, we have that the likelihood has the form\n\n$$f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\prod_{i=1}^{n_j} f_j\\left(y_{j, i} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}_j\\right).$$ {#eq-ind-groups-likelihood1}\n\nIt now remains to specify a prior on each $\\bs{\\theta}_j$.  Of course, if the groups are independent of one another, it is also reasonable to assume the parameters are independent of one another.  This leads to \n\n$$\\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\pi_j(\\bs{\\theta}_j).$$ {#eq-ind-groups-prior1}\n\nNow let's consider the perspective of a single population exposed to two treatments.  Specifically, let $Y_i$ be the response for the $i$-th observation in the population, and we let $x_i$ be a variable that indicates to which treatment the $i$-th observation has been exposed; that is, $x_i = j$ if the $i$-th observation has been exposed to the $j$-th treatment.  We then have that $Y_i \\stackrel{Ind}{\\sim} f\\left(y \\mid \\bs{\\theta}_{x_i}\\right)$.  Notice that we do not say that the responses are identically distributed; while the family of distributions is the same (all have the same $f$), the parameters on which each distribution depends is allowed to differ (based on the value of $x_i$).  Therefore, we are only willing to say the observations are independent.  The likelihood then has the form\n\n$$f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f\\left(y \\mid \\bs{\\theta}_{x_i}\\right).$$ {#eq-ind-groups-likelihood2}\n\nIt now remains to specify a prior on each $\\bs{\\theta}_j$.  If we are willing to assume the treatment groups are independent of one another, it is also reasonable to assume the parameters are independent of one another.  This leads to\n\n$$\\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) = \\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\pi_j(\\bs{\\theta}_j).$$ {#eq-ind-groups-prior2}\n\n@eq-ind-groups-likelihood1 and @eq-ind-groups-likelihood2 are equivalent models for the likelihood; similarly, @eq-ind-groups-prior1 and @eq-ind-groups-prior2 are equivalent models for the prior.  \n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhen comparing groups, whether you view the groups as separate populations or a single population exposed to different treatments, the inference is the same provided the groups are independent.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nIn order to extend inference from a single variable to comparing groups, we essentially allow our parameters to be based on the group from which the data was taken.  That is, we add a second layer to our model.\n:::\n\n:::{#exm-csec-independent-groups}\n## C-Section Deliveries Continued\n@exm-csec introduced a study, a component of which includes estimating the probability of a mother undergoing a C-section delivery at a particular hospital.  That example focused on estimating the C-section rate at a particular hospital.  However, there are two hospitals in Terre Haute, Indiana.  Suppose we are now interested in extending the study to compare the rate of C-sections at the two hospitals.\n\nDevelop a suitable model for addressing this new research objective.\n:::\n\n:::{.solution}\nLet $Y_{j, i}$ denote the number of vaginal deliveries at hospital $j$ prior to the $i$-th C-section we observe at hospital $j$.  Further, let $\\theta_j$ denote the rate of C-sections at hospital $j$; our interest is in comparing $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.  Following the discussion of @exm-csec, we have that\n\n$$Pr\\left(Y_{j,i} = y\\right) = \\theta_j \\left(1 - \\theta_j\\right)^y \\qquad y = 0, 1, 2, \\dotsc.$$\n\nFurther, it is reasonable to assume that whether a mother undergoes a C-section at one hospital is unrelated to whether a mother undergoes a C-section at the other hospital.  Therefore, we can consider $Y_{1,i}$ to be independent of $Y_{2,k}$ for all choices of $i$ and $k$. And, since each birth is independent, we can consider $Y_{j,1}, Y_{j,2}, \\dotsc, Y_{j, n}$ to be a random sample from the $j$-th hospital.  Note that while we have set $n$ to be the same for both hospitals, this is not a requirement.\n\nLetting $\\bm{Y} = \\left(Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,2}, \\dotsc, Y_{1,n}, Y_{2, 1}, Y_{2, 2}, \\dotsc, Y_{2, n}\\right)^\\top$ be the random vector of observations, the likelihood is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta})\n    &= \\prod_{j=1}^{2} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f_{Y_{j,i}}\\left(y_{j,i} \\mid \\theta_j\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\prod_{j=1}^{2} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\theta_j \\left(1 - \\theta_j\\right)^{y_{j,i}} \\\\\n    &= \\prod_{j=1}^{2} \\theta_j^n \\left(1 - \\theta_j\\right)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{j,i}} \\\\\n    &= \\theta_1^n \\left(1 - \\theta_1\\right)^{n\\bar{y}_1} \\theta_2^n \\left(1 - \\theta_2\\right)^{n\\bar{y}_2}, \n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-csec-ind-likelihood}\n\nwhere $\\bar{y}_j$ represents the observed sample mean for hospital $j$.  We note that the likelihood expressly captures both populations and therefore acknowledges the dependence on the both parameters.\n\nWe now consider developing a prior distribution.  Since $\\theta_j$ is a probability, it seems reasonable to choose a Beta distribution for each parameter.  Further, if we believe the parameters are independent, the prior distribution is\n\n$$\\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(a_1 + b_1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(a_1\\right)\\Gamma\\left(b_1\\right)} \\theta_1^{a_1 - 1}\\left(1 - \\theta_1\\right)^{b_1 - 1}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(a_2 + b_2\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(a_2\\right)\\Gamma\\left(b_2\\right)} \\theta_2^{a_2 - 1}\\left(1 - \\theta_2\\right)^{b_2 - 1}.$$\n\nNotice that our choice of prior allows the hyperparameters to potentially differ for each hospital.\n:::\n\n\n## Bridge Sampling\nIn @sec-hypothesis-testing we introduced the idea of model comparison.  This is especially useful when comparing groups.  Consider a simple case in which we have two groups.  Specifically, suppose\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  Y_{1,i} &\\stackrel{IID}{\\sim} f(y \\mid \\theta_1) \\\\\n  Y_{2,i} &\\stackrel{IID}{\\sim} f(y \\mid \\theta_2) \\\\\n  Y_{1,i} &\\indep Y_{2,j} \\quad \\forall i, j\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\indep$ refers to independence.  In this example, the data generating process for each group is distinguished only by a potentially different value of the parameter.  It would be natural in such settings to consider the hypotheses\n\n$$H_0: \\theta_1 = \\theta_2 \\qquad \\text{vs.} \\qquad H_1: \\theta_1 \\neq \\theta_2.$$\n\nIf we place a continuous prior on the parameters, then the probability of $H_0$ must be 0.  One way of addressing this problem is to consider a clever prior which places mass along the _line_ equating the two parameters.  A more natural solution, however, is to think of this as a model comparison problem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\mathcal{M}_0:& \\quad Y_{j, i} \\stackrel{IID}{\\sim} f(y \\mid \\theta) \\\\\n    & \\quad \\theta \\sim \\pi_0(\\theta) \\\\\n  \\mathcal{M}_1:& \\quad Y_{j, i} \\stackrel{Ind}{\\sim} f(y \\mid \\theta_j) \\\\\n    & \\quad \\theta_j \\stackrel{Ind}{\\sim} \\pi_j(\\theta_j)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor $j = 1, 2$.  Notice that under model $\\mathcal{M}_0$, there is only a single parameter, capturing the null hypothesis $\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$.  And, model $\\mathcal{M}_1$ allows the flexibility for two parameters, capturing the alternative hypothesis.  We would therefore be interested in computing a Bayes Factor (see @def-bayes-factor) comparing these two models.  The problem is, the Bayes Factor depends on the evidence\n\n$$f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_j) = \\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}, \\mathcal{M}_j) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_j) d\\bs{\\theta}.$$\n\nUnfortunately, this integral is quite difficult to estimate.  Using the prior distribution and performing MC Integration techniques does not typically result in reliable estimation; this results from the prior distribution often being too vague.  Instead, the evidence is estimated from the posterior distribution using __bridge sampling__.\n\n:::{#def-bridge-sampling}\n## Bridge Sampling\nThe bridge sampling estimator of the marginal likelihood $m(\\bm{y})$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  m(\\bm{y}) \n    &= \\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) d\\bs{\\theta} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{E_g\\left[h(\\bs{\\theta}) f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta})\\right]}{E_{\\pi}\\left[h(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta}) \\right]} \\\\\n    &\\approx \\frac{m^{-1}\\sum_{j=1}^{m} h\\left(\\tilde{\\bs{\\theta}}_j\\right) f\\left(\\bm{y} \\mid \\tilde{\\bs{\\theta}}_j\\right) \\pi\\left(\\tilde{\\bs{\\theta}}_j\\right)}{m^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{m} h\\left(\\bs{\\theta}^*_j\\right) g\\left(\\bs{\\theta}^*_j\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n   \nwhere $h(\\bs{\\theta})$ is called the bridge function and $g(\\bs{\\theta})$ is the proposal distribution.  Here, $\\tilde{\\bs{\\theta}}$ denotes a random variate from the proposal distribution and $\\bs{\\theta}^*$ a random variate from the posterior; $E_g$ denotes taking an expectation with respect to the proposal distribution and $E_\\pi$ denotes taking an expectation with respect to the posterior distribution.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhile not required, it is typical to use a Normal distribution for the proposal distribution $g(\\bs{\\theta})$.\n:::\n\nBridge sampling is available in some software packages (such as R, for example).  While the details of bridge sampling are beyond the scope of this text, we do want to note that the definition comes from making the following observation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  1 &= \\frac{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}}{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}} \\\\\n  \\Rightarrow m(\\bm{y}) &= m(\\bm{y}) \\frac{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}}{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}}. \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe are able to multiply both sides by the prior predictive distribution because it will be non-negative on its support.  Next, recognize that the integral is with respect to $\\bs{\\theta}$; therefore, we can move the marginal distribution inside the integral in the denominator to get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  m(\\bm{y}) &= \\frac{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}}{\\int \\frac{f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta})}{m(\\bm{y})} h(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{\\int f(\\bm{y} \\mid \\bs{\\theta}) \\pi(\\bs{\\theta}) h(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}}{\\int \\pi(\\bs{\\theta} \\mid \\bm{y}) h(\\bs{\\theta}) g(\\bs{\\theta})d\\bs{\\theta}},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n   \nwhere the last equality makes use of the definition of the posterior distribution from Bayes Theorem.  Now, the top integral can be viewed in terms of an expectation over a random variable $\\bs{\\theta} \\sim g(\\bs{\\theta})$, and the denominator can be viewed as an expectation over a random variable which follows the posterior distribution.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nBridge sampling is an efficient algorithm for estimating the evidence of a model, allowing for computation of the Bayes
