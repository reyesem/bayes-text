This generally provokes unease in people, leading to a distrust of statistical results.  In this section we attack that distrust head on.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-data-statistical-process\n#| fig-cap: Illustration of the statistical process (reprint of @fig-basics-statistical-process).\n#| fig-alt: Reprint of @fig-basics-statistical-process.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/Basics-Stat-Process.jpg\")\n```\n\n\n## What Makes a Sample Reliable\nIf we are going to have some amount of faith in the statistical results we produce, we must have data in which we can place our trust.  _The Treachery of Images_ (@fig-data-pipe-img) is a canvas painting depicting a pipe, below which the artist wrote the French phrase \"This is not a pipe.\"  Regarding the painting, the artist said\n\n  > The famous pipe.  How people reproached me for it!  And yet, could you stuff my pipe?  No, it's just a representation, is it not?  So if I had written on my picture \"This is a pipe,\" I'd have been lying!\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-data-pipe-img\n#| fig-cap: _The Treachery of Images_ by Ren&eacute; Magritte.\n#| fig-alt: Image of a pipe that is captioned _this is not a pipe_.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./images/Data-Pipe.jpg\")\n```\n\nJust as a painting is a representation of the object it depicts, so a sample should be a representation of the population under study.  This is the primary requirement if we are to rely on the resulting data.  \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nIn order for a statistical analysis to be reliable, the sample must be _representative_ of the population under study.\n:::\n\nWe need to be careful to not get carried away in our expectations.  What constitutes \"representative\" really depends on the question, just as an artist chooses their depiction based on how they want to represent the object.  Let's consider the following example.\n\n:::{#exm-data-school-debt}\n## School Debt\nIn addition to a degree, college graduates also tend to leave with a large amount of debt due to college loans.  In 2012, a graduate with a student loan had an average debt of \\$29,400; for graduates from private non-profit institutions, the average debt was \\$32,300[^debt].\n\nSuppose we are interested in determining the average amount of debt in student loans carried by a graduating senior from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a small private non-profit engineering school.  There are many faculty at Rose-Hulman who choose to send their children to the institute.  Suppose we were to ask 25 such faculty members who have a child that attended the institute to report the amount of student loans their children carried upon graduation from Rose-Hulman.  Further, suppose we compile the responses and compute the average amount of debt.  Using the data, we might report that based on our study, there is significant evidence the average debt carried by a graduate of Rose-Hulman is far below the \\$32,300 reported above (great news for this year's graduating class)!  \n\nWhy should we be hesitant to trust the results from our study?\n:::\n\nMany objections to statistical results stem from a distrust of whether the data (the sample) is really representative of the population of interest.  Rose-Hulman, like many other universities, has a policy that the children of faculty may attend their university (assuming admittance) tuition-free.  We would therefore expect their children to carry much less debt than the typical graduating senior.  There is a mismatch between the group we would like to study and the data we have collected.\n\nThis example provides a nice backdrop for discussing what it means to be representative.  First, let's define our population; in this case, we are interested in graduating seniors from Rose-Hulman.  The variable of interest is the amount of debt carried in student loans; the parameter of interest is then the _average_ amount of debt in student loans carried by graduating seniors of Rose-Hulman.  However, the sample consists of only graduating seniors of Rose-Hulman _who have a parent employed by the institute_.\n\nWith regard to grade point average, the students in our sample are probably similar to all graduating seniors; the starting salary of the students in our sample is probably similar to all graduating seniors; the fraction of mechanical engineering majors versus math majors is probably similar.  So, in many regards the sample is representative of the population; however, it fails to be representative with regard to the variable of interest.  This is our concern.  The amount of debt carried by students in our sample is not representative of that debt carried by all graduating seniors from the university.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhen thinking about whether a sample is representative, focus your attention to the characteristics specific to your research question or with regard to how you intend to generalize the results.\n:::\n\nDoes that mean the sample we collected in @exm-data-school-debt is useless?  Yes and no.  The sample collected cannot be used to answer our initial question of interest since it is not representative of our population.  No statistical method can fix bad data; statistics adheres to the \"garbage-in, garbage-out\" phenomena.  If the data is bad, no analysis will undo that.  However, while the sample cannot be used to answer our initial question, it could be used to address a different question:\n\n  > What is the average amount of debt in student loans carried by graduating seniors from Rose-Hulman whose parent is a faculty member at the institute?\n\nFor this revised question, the sample may indeed be representative.  If we are working with previously collected data, we must consider the population to which our results will generalize.  That is, for what population is the given sample representative?  If we are collecting our data, we need to be sure we collect data in such a way that the data is representative of our target population.  Let's first look at what _not_ to do.\n\n\n## Poor Methods of Data Collection\n@exm-data-school-debt is an example of a \"convenience sample,\" when the subjects in the sample are chosen simply due to ease of collection.  Examples include surveying students only in your sorority when you are interested in all students who are part of a sorority on campus; taking soil samples from only your city when you are interested in the soil for the entire state; and, obtaining measurements from only one brand of phone, because it was the only one you could afford on your budget, when you are interested in studying all cell phones on the market.  A convenience sample is unlikely to be representative if there is a relationship between the ease of collection and the variable under study.  This was true in the School Debt example; the relationship of a student to a faculty member, which is what increased the ease of collection, was directly related to the amount of debt they carried.  As a result, the resulting sample was not representative of the population.\n\nWhen conducting a survey with human subjects, it is common to only illicit responses from volunteers.  Such \"volunteer samples\" tend to draw in those with extreme opinions.  Consider product ratings on Amazon.  Individual ratings tend to cluster around 5's and 1's.  This is because those customers who take time to submit a review (which is voluntary) tend to be those who are really thrilled with their product (and want to encourage others to purchase it) and those who are really disappointed with their purchase (and want to encourage others to avoid it).  Such surveys often fail to capture those individuals in the population who have \"middle of the road\" opinions.\n\nWe could not possibly name all the poor methods for collecting a sample; but, poor methods all share something in common --- it is much more likely the resulting sample is not representative.  Failing to be representative results in __biased__ estimates of the parameter.\n\n:::{#def-bias}\n## Bias\nA set of measurements is said to be biased if they are _consistently_ too high (or too low).  Similarly, an estimate of a parameter is said to be biased if it is _consistently_ too high (or too low).\n:::\n\nTo illustrate the concept of bias, consider shooting at a target as in @fig-data-bias.  We can consider the center of our target to be the parameter we would like to estimate within the population; in this case, some measure of center.  The values in our sample (the strikes on the target) will vary around the parameter; while we do not expect any one value to hit the target precisely, a \"representative\" sample is one in which the values tend to be clustered about the parameter (unbiased).  When the sample is not representative, the values in the sample tend to cluster off the mark (biased).  Notice that to be unbiased, it may be that not a single value in the sample is perfect, but aggregated together, they point in the right direction.  So, bias is not about an individual measurement being an \"outlier,\" (more on those in @sec-summaries) but about _consistently_ shooting in the wrong direction.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-data-bias\n#| fig-cap: Illustration of bias and precision.\n#| fig-alt: Four targets, the first with all markings clustered in the center, the second with all markings clustered above and right of the center, the third with markings spread out around the center, and the fourth with markings spread out below and left of the center.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./images/Data-Bias.jpg\")\n```\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## Accuracy vs. Precision\nThere is a difference between _accuracy_ and _precision_.  Generally, _accuracy_ refers to location (and therefore relates to bias); we say a process is accurate when it is unbiased.  _Precision_ refers to the variability; data which is more precise has less variability.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nBiased results are typically due to poor sampling methods that result in a sample which is not representative of the population of interest.\n:::\n\nThe catch (there is always a catch) is that we will never _know_ with certainty if a sample is actually representative or not.  In practice, we critically examine the method in which the sample was collected, and we use summaries of the sample to make educated decisions on whether to generalize the results.  Better, however, is to employ methods of data collection that help to minimize the bias in the sample.\n\n\n## Preferred Methods of Sampling\nNo method guarantees a perfectly representative sample; but, we can take measures to reduce or eliminate bias.  A useful strategy is to employ _randomization_.  This is summarized in our second Fundamental Idea.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## Fundamental Idea II\nIf data is to be useful for making conclusions about the population, a process referred to as drawing inference, proper data collection is crucial.  Randomization can play an important role ensuring a sample is representative and that inferential conclusions are appropriate.\n:::\n\nConsider the School Debt example (@exm-data-school-debt) again.  Suppose instead of the data collection strategy described there, we had done the following:\n\n  > We constructed a list of all graduating seniors from the institute.  We placed the name of each student on an index card; then, we thoroughly shuffled the cards and chose the top 25 cards.  For these 25 individuals, we recorded the amount of debt in student loans each carried.  \n  \nThis essentially describes using a lottery to select the sample.  This popular method is known as taking a __simple random sample__.  By conducting a lottery, we make it very unlikely that our sample consists of only students with a very small amount of student debt (as occurred when we used a convenience sample).\n\n:::{#def-simple-random-sample}\n## Simple Random Sample\nOften abbreviated SRS, this is a sample of size $n$ such that _every_ collection of size $n$ is equally likely to be the resulting sample.  This is equivalent to a lottery.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIt is convention to use $n$ to represent the sample size.\n:::\n\nThe primary benefit of a simple random sample is that it removes bias.  More specifically, the _process_ of simple random sampling is unbiased; that is, this process does _not_ produce values which are _consistently_ too high or low.\n\nThere are situations in which a simple random sample does not suffice.  Again, consider our School Debt example.  The Rose-Hulman student body is predominantly domestic, with only about 3% of the student body being international students.  But, suppose we are interested in comparing the average debt carried between international and domestic students.  It is very likely, by chance alone, that in a simple random sample of 25 students none will be international.  Instead of a simple random sample, we might consider taking a sample of 13 domestic students and a sample of 12 international students; this is an example of a __stratified random sample__.  This approach is useful when there is a natural grouping of interest within the population.\n\n:::{#def-stratified-random-sample}\n## Stratified Random Sample\nA sample in which the population is first divided into groups, or strata, based on a characteristic of interest; a simple random sample is then taken within each group.  \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nNote that a stratified random sample essentially results in a representative sample _within_ each strata.  However, the combined sample may not be representative of the population.  If there is interest in using the sample in its entirety, instead of comparing the strata in some way, advanced statistical methodology is required.  See texts on analyzing \"complex survey design\" for a more thorough discussion.  Our text will not consider such cases.\n:::\n\nThere are countless sampling techniques used in practice.  The two described above can be very useful starting points for developing a custom method suitable for a particular application.  Their benefit stems from their use of randomization as it limits researcher influence on the composition of the sample and therefore minimizes bias.\n\nThis section is entitled \"Preferred Methods\" because while these methods are ideal, they are not always practical.  Consider the Deepwater Horizon Case Study described in @sec-caseDeepwater; conceptually, we can take a simple random sample of the volunteers for our study.  However, as with any study involving human subjects, researchers would be required to obtain consent from each subject in the study.  That is, any individual has the right to refuse to participate in the study.  Therefore, it is unlikely that a simple random sample as described above could be obtained.  While random selection is a nice tool, the goal is a sample which is _representative_ of the population.  While random sampling is helpful for accomplishing this, we may need to appeal to the composition of the sample itself to justify its use.  _Based on the characteristics of those willing to participate in the study, do we feel the study participants form a representative group of all volunteers?_  That is the essential question.  This is often why studies report a table summarizing participant demographics such as age, gender, etc.  It is also why it is extremely important for researchers to describe how observations were obtained so that readers may make the judgement for themselves whether the sample is representative.\n\n\n[^debt]:
