In this chapter, we are interested in allowing the (continuous) distribution of the random variable that represents the response to depend on one or more predictors.  Let's begin with an example to illustrate the range of questions we might ask in such a setting.\n\n:::{#exm-therapy}\n## Rehabilitation Therapy\nPhysical therapy is a vital part of the recovery from any surgery, particularly surgery which impacts motor function, such as knee or hip surgery.  A researcher at a local rehabilitation center was interested in the recovery time of individuals who have undergone corrective knee surgery.  Specifically, the researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the physical fitness (of persons undergoing corrective knee surgery) prior to surgery and the time required in physical therapy until successful rehabilitation (\"recovery time\").  Patient records in the rehabilitation center were examined, and 24 male subjects ranging in age from 18 to 30 years who had undergone similar corrective knee surgery during the past year were selected for the study.  The following information was obtained from the case record of each patient:\n\n  - Recovery Time: number of days of physical therapy until the subject has met their physical therapy goals.\n  - Prior Activity Level: physical fitness status (low, moderate, high) prior to surgery; this is based on a questionnaire asking about the frequency of various physical activity over the course of a typical week.\n  - Age: age (years, rounded to nearest tenth).\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWe note that this study has potential bias.  The initial question was framed in terms of all patients undergoing corrective knee surgery, but the sample consists of only male patients.  Unfortunately, for a number of years, women were highly underrepresented in medical research (with the exception of studies involving cosmetic products), and individuals who do not identify as male or female continue to be underrepresented in medical studies.\n:::\n\nBy all accounts, this is a small study, recording only 3 variables on 24 subjects.  Yet, even with only a few variables, there are a myriad of potential questions that require more complex models than we have previously discussed.  Consider the following:\n\n  - Overall, is the recovery time, on average, linearly related to the age of patients?\n  - For subjects of the same age, is there a relationship between the recovery time, on average, and the prior activity level of patients?\n  - Does the relationship between the recovery time, on average, and the age of a patient depend on the patient's prior activity level?\n  - Does the variability in the recovery time depend on the age of the patient?\n  \nAny one of these questions could be the focus of a researcher.  Notice that each, though, is slightly different.  While the first question involves a relationship between a quantitative response and a quantitative variable, the second involves a quantitative response and multiple predictors (one quantitative and one categorical) with a desire to essentially \"isolate\" the impact of one of the predictors.  The third question looks at how the relationship between the response and predictor might be modified by a third variable; and, the fourth looks at a relationship impacting the variability instead of the mean response.  Each of these questions require us to move beyond the methods we have previously discussed.  And, each of these questions shares a similar structure.\n\nWe might be tempted to force these questions into the \"comparison of groups\" approach studied previously.  To examine the difference in recovery time across age, for example, we might categorize subjects as \"in their teens\" or \"in their 20's.\"  However, this approach prevents us from examining smooth trends across age.  Such categorizations can also lead to categories with a very small number of subjects, meaning our priors will have undue influence on the results.  We will consider an alternative approach.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nBroadly speaking, there are three types of scientific questions that regression models allow us to address:\n\n  - Marginal relationships: captures the \"overall\" relationship between two variables, ignoring any other contributing factors.\n  - Adjusted relationships: captures the effect of a variable after \"isolating\" it from other contributing factors.\n  - Effect Modification: captures how the effect of one variable on the response is modified by a second contributing factor.\n  \nOf course, regardless of these types of scientific questions we might address, we can also use our model to predict a future observation given a specific set of contributing factors.\n:::\n\n\n## Developing a Model\nIn many introductory statistics courses, statistical models are typically introduced in the following generic form:\n\n$$\\text{Response} = \\text{Signal} + \\text{Noise}.$$\n\nThe \"response\" is the variable we would like to explain or predict.  The \"signal\" represents the part of the data generating process we can explain; it is the deterministic portion of the model and is a function of the predictor(s).  The \"noise\" represents the stochastic portion capturing the variability observed beyond what can be explained by the deterministic portion alone.  The common starting point for such a model is the simple linear regression model:\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i + \\varepsilon_i.$$\n\nThis model views the deterministic portion of the model as a line.  Notice that any two subjects with the same value of the predictor would have the same value for the deterministic portion of the model; however, the two subjects will not necessarily have the same response as the noise $\\varepsilon_i$ can differ from one subject to the next.  Of course, this model is too vague to be helpful; so, we place additional constraints on the stochastic portion.  In particular, we place conditions on the _distribution_ of $\\varepsilon_i$.  For example, we might assume that $E\\left(\\varepsilon_i\\right) = 0$ or that the $\\varepsilon_i$'s are identically distributed.\n\nNotice that this approach, while reasonable, does not align with the approach we have taken thus far in the course.  Instead of thinking of the response as a signal plus noise and then placing conditions on the distribution of the noise, we have considered fully specifying the distributional form of the data generating process.  That is, we specified the likelihood $f(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.  This approach is preferred in the Bayesian perspective (and in the classical perspective in our opinion) because it generalizes more easily and provides a unifying framework for inference.  It is within this context of fully specifying the likelihood that we consider developing regression models.\n\n:::{#def-regression}\n## Regression\nA regression model is one for which the parameter(s) governing the data generating process depends on one or more predictors.  \"Parametric\" regression models do this through specifying a functional form for the dependence of the parameter(s) on the predictor(s).\n:::\n\nTo illustrate the scope of @def-regression, let's consider several potential models we might consider in the Bayesian framework.  Consider\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i \\mid \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2 \\ind N\\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\sigma^2\\right).$$ {#eq-normal-model}\n\nNotice that @eq-normal-model allows the _mean_ response to depend on the predictor through the form\n\n$$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i.$$\n\nThat is, instead of a single mean response $\\mu$, the mean response is determined only after first specifying the value of the predictor.  As the mean response differs for each subject, depending on their value of the predictor, the responses are _not_ identically distributed.  However, we have retained the assumption that the responses are independent of one another (given the unknown parameters).  Further, it is _only_ the mean response that is impacted by the predictor.  The variance of the response is not impacted but remains constant across all observations.  This model also fully specifies the distributional form of the response --- it is a Normal distribution.\n\nIn contrast to @eq-normal-model, consider\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i \\mid \\alpha, \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1 \\ind Gamma\\left(\\alpha (\\text{Predictor 1})_i^2, \\gamma_0e^{\\gamma_1 (\\text{Predictor 2})_i}\\right),$$ {#eq-gamma-model}\n\nwhich says the responses follow a Gamma distribution where the shape parameter depends on \"Predictor 1\" through a quadratic relationship; and, the rate parameter depends on \"Predictor 2\" through an exponential function.  Again, while the responses are not identically distributed, they remain independent.  Both @eq-normal-model and @eq-gamma-model extend common distributional models by allowing the parameters to depend on predictors.  The model that is appropriate should be driven by the research objectives and discipline expertise.\n\nTo get a sense of how model construction is related to the research objectives, let's return to @eq-normal-model.  Notice that by replacing the mean with a functional form, we have introduced new parameters into the distribution: $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$.  These parameters govern the mean response.  As a result, their interpretation is tied to the mean response:\n\n  - $\\beta_0$ represents the mean response when the value of the predictor is 0.\n  - $\\beta_1$ represents the change in the mean response when the predictor is increased by 1 unit.\n  \nNotice that the interpretation of the parameters could be related to specific scientific questions.  If we are interested in how changes in the predictor relate with changes in the response, we are interested in $\\beta_1$.\n\nThe interpretation of $\\alpha$ in @eq-gamma-model is not as clear.  It represents the shape parameter when the first predictor takes a value of 1; since the shape parameter is not directly interpretable in terms of the response (like the mean or variance is), this interpretation is less satisfying.  But, we know that $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma_0}$ would represent the average response when the first predictor takes a value of 1 and the second predictor takes a value of 0.  That is, through a combination of the parameters, we have some sense of the mean response.\n\nOf course, there are infinitely many other models we could specify.  The distributional family could vary (Normal, Gamma, Beta, a mixture, etc.); the functional form could vary (linear, exponential, sinusoidal, etc.); the parameters impacted could vary (mean, shape, rate, etc.).  What is common to each of these potential models is that we specify the distribution of the response allowing key aspects of the distribution to vary as functions of the predictor(s).\n\nSpecifying the distribution of the response is only a portion of the model under the Bayesian framework.  Returning to the distributional family specified in @eq-normal-model, the assumption of independence allows us to easily construct the likelihood, given by\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f\\left(\\mathbf{Response} \\mid \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2\\right) \n    &= \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f\\left((\\text{Response})_i \\mid \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\left(2\\pi \\sigma^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left((\\text{Response})_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i\\right)^2\\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe present this to show that the likelihood can quickly become difficult to work with as the complexity of the distributional model grows.  \n\n## Simple Extensions\nAs previously stated, the distributional model in @eq-normal-model represents a common model for introducing regression.  However, there are two simple extensions that are worth considering.  First, we consider the inclusion of multiple predictors.  For example, given $p$ predictors, we might posit that\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i \\mid \\bs{\\beta}, \\sigma^2 \\ind N\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j (\\text{Predictor } j)_i, \\sigma^2\\right)$$ {#eq-normal-model-multiple}\n\nfor $j = 1, 2, \\dots, p$, giving a likelihood of\n\n$$f\\left(\\mathbf{Response} \\mid \\bs{\\beta}, \\sigma^2\\right) = \\left(2 \\pi \\sigma^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left\\{- \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left((\\text{Response})_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j (\\text{Predictor } j)_i\\right)^2\\right\\}.$$\n\nThis model allows several predictors to impact the mean response.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhile it is common to have the predictors enter the model such that the mean response is linear _in the parameters_, this is not a requirement.  We could easily allow the predictors to impact the mean response through some nonlinear function.\n:::\n\nSecond, nothing requires that the response follow a Normal distribution.  For example, we might posit that\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i + \\varepsilon_i,$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon_i \\iid t_{\\nu}$.  While we have specified this in a \"signal plus noise\" form, notice that we are simply saying the response can be modeled by a t-distribution which has been shifted to be centered on $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i$.  \n\nBoth of these extensions are complex from a classical perspective, requiring different machinery to be able to conduct inference.  However, from the Bayesian perspective, we have specified a different model, but the process for performing inference remains exactly the same: specify a distribution to capture the prior information (see @sec-reg-priors) and then compute the posterior distribution (typically using MCMC methods).\n\n\n## Fixed vs. Random Predictors\nYou may have noticed that @eq-normal-model only specified the distribution of the response variable as a function of the predictor; it omitted the distribution of the predictor itself.  For a designed experiment in which the values of all predictors are determined in advance by the researchers, the predictors are constants.  As such, the notation of @eq-normal-model is appropriate.  However, in many situations, the predictors are not fixed in advanced but observed during the data collection; that is, the predictors can also be viewed as observed values of random variables which vary across individuals in the population.  Consider the Rehabilitation example (@exm-therapy) above; the age of each patient is unknown prior to the study.  We expect the age to vary across individuals who have undergone knee replacement; therefore, age has a distribution across the population that should be modeled.\n\nIt is common in a regression analysis to _condition_ on the predictors when making inference.  Consider @eq-normal-model; if we believe the predictor is not determined in advance, but we condition on the value of the predictor, then our model would be expressed as\n\n$$(\\text{Response})_i \\mid (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2 \\ind N\\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\sigma^2\\right).$$ {#eq-normal-model-cond}\n\nThe likelihood for this model is equivalent to what we had before; in fact, nothing about our analysis changes.  However, conceptually, we are saying that our model applies only after knowing the value of the predictor.  As a result, the model does not specify the distribution of the predictor, and all interpretations assume we have access to the predictor prior to making a statement about the response.\n\nWhile it is common to condition on the predictors when making inference, it is not a requirement.  Including the distribution of the predictors is simply a modeling exercise when developing the likelihood.  Since @eq-normal-model-cond already specifies the conditional distribution of the response given the predictor, adding a statement about the marginal distribution of the predictor leads to a hierarchical model that fully specifies the distribution of all observed variables.  For example, we might consider the model\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  (\\text{Response})_i \\mid (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2 \n    &\\ind N\\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\sigma^2\\right) \\\\\n  (\\text{Predictor}_i \\mid \\gamma, \\eta^2 &\\iid N\\left(\\gamma, \\eta^2\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-normal-model-full}\n\nWhile @eq-normal-model-full has the same predictor as in @eq-normal-model; however, it fully specifies the distribution of all observed variables.  The likelihood of the observed data is then \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f\\left(\\mathbf{Data} \\mid \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2, \\gamma, \\eta^2\\right) \n    &= \\prod_{i=1}^{n} f\\left((\\text{Response})_i \\mid (\\text{Predictor})_i, \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma^2\\right) g\\left((\\text{Predictor})_i \\mid \\gamma, \\eta^2\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\left(2\\pi \\sigma^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left((\\text{Response})_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 (\\text{Predictor})_i\\right)^2\\right\\} \\\\\n    &\\qquad \\cdot \\left(2\\pi \\eta^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\eta^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left((\\text{Predictor})_i - \\gamma\\right)^2\\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile clearly a more complex model, the benefit is that we are able to simultaneously predict the value of the predictor and response for a future observation.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhile it is common to model the response conditional on the predictors and not specify the distribution of the predictors, it is possible to fully specify the likelihood of all observed variables, if desired.\n:::\n\n\n## Interpreting the Predictors\nAs we have already stated, the range of potential models is infinitely large; as a result, there is no one interpretation we can provide for a parameter in the model.  However, it is common that the predictors in a regression model govern the mean response.  For example, @eq-normal-model-multiple considers multiple predictors, but each impacts the mean response while assuming the variance $\\sigma^2$ is constant across the population.  In this model, $\\beta_j$ describe the relationship between the response and the $j$-th predictor.  Specifically,\n\n  > $\\beta_j$ is the change in the average response given a 1-unit increase in the $j$-th predictor, _holding all other predictors fixed_.\n\nWe can also provide an interpretation for the intercept $\\beta_0$:\n\n  > $\\beta_0$ is the average value of the response when _all_ predictors take the value 0.\n  \nWhile not governing the mean response, we should not ignore the interpretation of $\\sigma^2$:\n\n  > $\\sigma^2$ is the variability in the response for a _fixed set of predictors_.\n  \nThese interpretations seem straight forward but are hiding a lot of complexity.  Working backward, notice the conditional/cross-sectional nature of the interpretation of $\\sigma^2$.  It is _not_ the overall variability in the response; it is the variability of the response for any fixed set of values for the predictors.  That is, the model is specifying the distribution of the response for a specified level of the predictors.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nRecall that a marginal distribution and a conditional distribution of a random variable are distinct distributions.  The distributional model of the response in a regression setting is conditional on the values of the predictors, and the form of the marginal distribution of the response need not have the same form.\n:::\n\nNext, we notice that the interpretation of $\\beta_0$ may not always make sense in context.  For example, suppose our response is the weight of individuals (in pounds) and our predictor is their height (in inches).  It does not make sense to talk about an individual with a height of 0 inches.  This is the result of extrapolation.\n\n:::{#def-extrapolation}\n## Extrapolation\nExtrapolation occurs when we use a model to predict outside of the region for which data is available.\n:::\n\nThe danger with extrapolation is that without scientific justification, we have no reason to believe the model we have observed in one region of the support will continue to hold for all regions of the support.  For example, it is possible the relationship between the mean response and the predictor is linear on the interval $(a, b)$, but it becomes quadratic outside of this interval.  If we fit the model on the interval $(a, b)$ and then predict outside this range, our predictions will be biased.  This is what can lead to senseless interpretation of $\\beta_0$.  We should always be cautious of extrapolation.\n\nFinally, and we cannot emphasize the benefit of this enough, the interpretation of $\\beta_j$ measures the effect of the $j$-th predictor _holding the value of other predictors in the model fixed_.  This means that in a regression model, we are naturally isolating the effect of the predictor.  This provides a unique interpretation to a hypothesis of the form\n\n$$H_0: \\beta_j = 0 \\qquad \\text{vs.} \\qquad H_1: \\beta_j \\neq 0.$$\n\nThis hypothesis is really asking whether the $j$-th predictor is linearly associated with the mean response _after accounting for the impact of the other predictors in the model_.\n\n:::{#exm-therapy-likelihood}\n## Rehabilitation Therapy Continued\n@exm-therapy described a study to investigate recovery time among patients who have undergone a corrective knee surgery.  Suppose we are willing to believe that the mean recovery time is linearly related to the age of a patient.  Further, suppose that we believe that given the age of the patient, the recovery time will follow an Exponential distribution.  Write down the likelihood for the observed data conditional on the age of the patient.\n:::\n\n:::{.solution}\nRecall that for an exponential distribution, the mean response is given by the scale parameter; therefore, the mean response fully characterizes the distribution.  If we are willing to assume that given a patient's age, the recovering time of one patient is unrelated to the recovery time of any other patient, then based on the description, we have\n\n$$(\\text{Recovery Time})_i \\mid (\\text{Age})_i, \\beta_0, \\beta_1 \\ind Exp\\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i\\right),$$\n\nwhere the Exponential distribution is parameterized by its scale parameter.  This results in a likelihood of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f\\left(\\mathbf{Recovery Time} \\right. &\\mid \\left. \\mathbf{Age}, \\beta_0, \\beta_1\\right)  \n    = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i} \\exp\\left\\{- \\frac{(\\text{Recovery Time})_i}{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i}\\right\\} \\\\\n    &= \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i}\\right] \\exp\\left\\{-\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(\\text{Recovery Time})_i}{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i}\\right\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-therapy-likelihood}\n\nThe likelihood does not reduce to a simple form.  \n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Reparameterization\nConsider the proposed solution to @exm-therapy-likelihood.  Recall that the scale parameter of an Exponential distribution must be positive; however, nothing in the above specification requires the linear predictor\n\n$$\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i$$\n\nbe positive for all ages.  Often times, this is not a problem; the region of reasonable values of the parameter will result in a positive value of the scale parameter within the range of our data (again, extrapolation could be problematic).  However, we might be in a case where reasonable values of the parameter lead to negative mean responses; or, it could be that the MCMC algorithm wanders into such regions creating numerical instability in the algorithm itself.  Regardless, if we would like to enforce the constraint that the mean response be positive, we have two options.\n\nFirst, we could address the constraint by ensuring that both $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are restricted to be positive.  This could be done by choosing priors which have support on the positive real line, for example.  Alternatively, we could reparameterize the model to force $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ to be positive.  That is, we write\n\n$$(\\text{Recovery Time})_i \\mid (\\text{Age})_i, \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1 \\ind Exp\\left(e^{\\gamma_0} + e^{\\gamma_1} (\\text{Age})_i\\right),$$\n\nwhere we have substituted $\\beta_0 = e^{\\gamma_0}$ and $\\beta_1 = e^{\\gamma_1}$.  Notice that $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ will be positive for any value of $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$; therefore, we now have unconstrained parameters $\\gamma_0$ and $\\gamma_1$ and yet have constrained the mean response to be positive.\n\nThere is yet a third option.  We could reparameterize the mean response directly.  That is, we consider\n\n$$(\\text{Recovery Time})_i \\mid (\\text{Age})_i, \\beta_0, \\beta_1 \\ind Exp\\left(e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{Age})_i}\\right).$$\n\nIn this specification, there are no constraints on $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, but we have ensured that the mean response is positive.  This has come at a cost, however; in this specification, the mean recovery time is no longer linearly related to age.\n\nReparameterization is a helpful tool to consider to enforce constraints in a numerically stable way.\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["mystyles.css"],"output-file":"06b-linear-regression.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
