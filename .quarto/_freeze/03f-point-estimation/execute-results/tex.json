For those very comfortable with probability theory, we may not shy away from having an entire distribution presented to us as a way of summarizing the information available about the parameter.  However, we know there are ways of summarizing a distribution, and often practitioners prefer to be presented with a summary of the posterior distribution.  In this chapter, we examine methods for estimating the parameter of interest using the posterior distribution.   \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Big Idea\nEstimating the parameter of interest is typically done by summarizing the _location_ of the posterior distribution.\n:::\n\nA course in probability introduces us to the idea of using the mean, the median, and/or the mode in order summarize the location of a distribution.  We can apply the same techniques to summarize the location of the posterior distribution.  The three common point estimates for a parameter in the Bayesian framework are the posterior mean, the posterior median, and posterior mode.\n\n:::{#def-posterior-mean}\n## Posterior Mean\nThe posterior mean is the average value of the parameter, given the data:\n\n$$E\\left[\\bs{\\theta} \\mid \\bm{y}\\right] = \\int \\bs{\\theta} \\pi(\\theta \\mid \\bm{y}) d\\bs{\\theta}.$$\n:::\n\nWe note that as the dimension of the parameter vector increases, this could be a very difficult integral to compute.  We will address this issue in the next unit.  For now, we will typically work with known distributions and therefore known expressions for the posterior mean.\n\n:::{#def-posterior-median}\n## Posterior Median\nWe are 50% sure, given the data, the parameter falls below the posterior median.  Formally, the posterior median is the value $q$ such that\n\n$$0.5 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{q} \\pi(\\theta \\mid \\bm{y}) d\\theta.$$\n:::\n\nWhile closed-form solutions may exist for the posterior mean, even with known distributions the posterior median must often be computed numerically.  This is not problematic; we are simply acknowledging that in statistics, numerical solutions are common and are not viewed as inferior.\n\n:::{#def-posterior-mode}\n## Posterior Mode\nWe think of the posterior mode as the most likely value of the parameter, given the data.  If the posterior distribution is continuous, the posterior mode is the value of the parameter that maximizes the posterior distribution.  Formally, the posterior mode is given by\n\n$$\\arg \\max_{\\theta} \\pi(\\theta \\mid \\bm{y}).$$\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe posterior mode only makes sense as an estimate if the posterior distribution is unimodal.\n:::\n\nOne might ask which of the three estimates is \"best.\"  It depends.  The mean and median may not be representative of a \"typical\" value. The mean is more sensitive to extreme values; the median tends to be more stable. However, many software packages default to reporting the posterior mean, making it a popular choice out of simplicity. Again, regardless of which value we choose to report, we should not neglect that we have access to the entire posterior distribution; therefore, we are not limited by a single estimate but can provide a much richer summary of the posterior distribution.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nIt is common for those first learning the Bayesian framework to confuse the parameter being estimated with the method of estimation used. We can use the posterior mode to estimate the mean response. We can use the posterior mean to estimate the variance of the response. The method of estimation (posterior mean, posterior median, or posterior mode) is _not_ linked to the parameter (mean response, variance of the response, etc.).\n:::\n\nWe close this chapter by considering two examples.  First, consider @exm-naive-posterior.  Since the support of the posterior includes only two values (0.246 and 0.563), the posterior mean would necessarily take a value not in the support.  The posterior median suffers from the same limitation.  The posterior mode is 0.246, since it is the more likely value, given the data and the individual's prior beliefs.  Note, however, that we lose information by only reporting the point estimate; we have a much richer conclusion when we report the entire posterior distribution: we are 71.69% sure the students are from RHIT and 28.31% sure the students are from ISU.\n\n:::{#exm-csec-point-estimate}\n## C-section Deliveries Continued\n@exm-csec introduced a study, a component of which includes estimating the probability of a mother undergoing a C-section delivery at a particular hospital.  \n\n@exm-csec-posterior found the posterior distribution to be\n\n$$\\theta \\mid \\bm{x} \\sim Beta\\left(n + a, n\\bar{x} + b\\right)$$\n\nwhere $a = 17, b = 39, n = 15$ and $n\\bar{x} = 33$ given the observed data.  Estimate the rate of C-sections at the hospital given the observed data.\n:::\n\n:::{.solution}\nWhile it may seem obvious, our estimate is based on the _observed data_; different data would lead to a different estimate.  Hidden in that statement is that our estimate is also based (at least partially) on our prior beliefs; different prior beliefs may also lead to a different estimate.\n\nSince the distributional family of the posterior is well-studied (a Beta distribution), we can make use of established properties in computing our point estimate.  In particular, we immediately have that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  E\\left(\\theta \\mid \\bm{x}\\right)\n    &= \\frac{n + a}{n + a + n\\bar{x} + b} = 0.308 \\\\\n  \\text{Posterior Mode} \n    &= \\frac{n + a - 1}{n + a + n\\bar{x} + b - 2} = 0.304.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhile we must compute it numerically, the posterior median is also readily available and is given by 0.306.  All three estimates are extremely similar.  Given the data, we estimate the C-section rate at the hospital to be just over 30% (very near the rate in the state of Indiana).\n:::",
